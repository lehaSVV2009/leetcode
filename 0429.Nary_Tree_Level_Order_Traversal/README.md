## Description

Given an n-ary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values. (ie, from left to right, level by level).

## Example

For example, given a 3-ary tree:

![Tree](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/10/12/narytreeexample.png)  

We should return its level order traversal:

```
[
     [1],
     [3,2,4],
     [5,6]
]
```

## Note:

* The depth of the tree is at most 1000.
* The total number of nodes is at most 5000.
