## Description

Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

*You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.*

## Example

```
Given nums = [7, 11, 2, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[2] = 7 + 2 = 9,
return [0, 2].
